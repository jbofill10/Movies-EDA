# Movies-EDA
Looking at a data set containing meta data on 45,000 movies.

The data set can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset  

I could not upload all the files directly due to some being too big. I have included some of the smaller csvs in the repository for a sample of what the data looks like though.
